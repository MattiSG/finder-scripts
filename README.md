# Finder script suite

Various utility scripts to ease navigating in the Mac OS X Finder.

## Usage

Most of these small apps come with an icon that fits well in the Finder toolbar. To add them, drag them on the Finder toolbar and wait for a second.

### Browse Full Screen

When launched, this app will maximise the current Finder window, switch it to Cover Flow mode and hide the dock. When launched again, it will restore that window to its previous state.

### Clear folder appearance

When a folder is dropped on this app, it will have its appearance preferences reinitialised.

### Directory Traverser

Saves a right-click and “Show package contents” on packages (`.app`, `.pkg`, `.pages`…). Drop a package or folder on this app, or open it with one selected in the Finder.

### Go to parent folder

Allows for parent folder navigation through the mouse rather than the command-up shortcut or command-clicking the folder name.

## Deprecation notice

These scripts have not been maintained since Mac OS X has started to require accessibility privileges to manipulate the Finder.
