# Finder script suite

Various utility scripts to ease navigating in the Mac OS X Finder.

## Usage

Most of these small apps come with an icon that fits well in the Finder toolbar. To add them, drag them on the Finder toolbar and wait for a second.

### Browse Full Screen

![Browse full screen icon](icons/Browse%20Full%20Screen/Browse%20Full%20Screen%20-%2032.png)

When launched, this app will maximise the current Finder window, switch it to Cover Flow mode and hide the dock. When launched again, it will restore that window to its previous state.
